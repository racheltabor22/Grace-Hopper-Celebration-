**Resume Review**
Remember: Employers may spend thirty seconds to a minute and a half examining your resume in the initial screening process. They may then discard, file or further consider your qualifications (invite you in for an interview). Your resume and cover letter must be perfect (no errors!) in order to pass the first minimal level of screening.

_____ Accessible address, telephone number(s) and email; include permanent and school addresses, if different psu.edu email address is recommended

_____ Objective, if included, is clear, naming specific skills to be utilized; brief and to the point; not “me- centered” 

_____ Section headings are descriptive (minimum: EDUCATION and EXPERIENCE) to showcase relevant information. SKILLS section supports objective.


CONTENT AND SKILLS SELLING ABILITY

_____ Highlights main points (bullets, capitalization, underlining, italics, or bold)

_____ Uses goal-directed, specific, self-confident statements showcasing accomplishments and results or skills used

STYLE

_____ Consistent punctuation and formatting style throughout resume

_____ Error free, no misspellings (Use spell-checker, but don’t rely on it exclusively!)

_____ Grammatically correct; appropriate and consistent verb tense used within sections

_____ Designed for skimming; concise and to the point; phrases begin with verbs; no prose or “I” statements


OVERALL APPEARANCE

_____ Appropriate length (1 page preferred; 2 page maximum—name and page number appears at top of second page)

_____ Easy to read type-size (10 – 12 pt. usually) and font style

_____ Visually pleasing; professional looking; easy to pick out main points

 
ADDITIONAL HINTS

_____ Personal information (religion, age, marital status, etc.) is NOT included

_____ Abbreviations or acronyms are written out unless very commonly understood ( e.g. MBA)

 

COVER LETTER SELF-REVIEW

_____ Acceptable business letter format is used (generally left justified items, single spaced paragraphs, with double spaces between paragraphs)

_____ Heading at the top includes my 2 line address and the current date

_____ Inside address of the recipient is included with his/her job title, if known

_____ Greeting is professional- Dear Mr. / Ms. So-and-So: Alternate example- Dear Intern Recruiter:

_____ First paragraph makes a strong start as to why I am writing to this particular employer

_____ Middle paragraph(s) highlights some of my strengths and skills as they relate to this job or company

_____ Closing paragraph indicates how to contact me, and that I fill follow-up in a week

_____ There is space for my signature below the closing phrase (“Sincerely”) and my name is typed below my signature

_____ The word “Enclosure” is below my name, to indicate that my resume is included with the letter

Note: 

For the Grace Hopper Database, you will want to include a generic style resume that is tailored to the type of job or internship that you want. 

When applying to specific jobs, ensure that your letter and resume is customized to an individual employer and is not just a generic letter. Use specific keywords from the job description.

**Conference and Zine**

Each GHC student is required to attend the majority of the GHC conference.  In addition to attending the meet and greets and resume workshop, during the conference, you must attend the  keynote, job fair, virtual networking events and at least two panels / talks.    

By October 8, you will submit a poster/spread that reviews your experience attending the Virtual Grace Hopper Event.   

Your review must include: 

- Name, year, major 

- A title that reflects the Grace Hopper Celebration 

- Several photos of you attending the virtual event and screenshots of the event.  

- A written reflection about your experience, how did you attend, what you learned, what opportunities you gained, advice for attending next year.  

- A written summary and review of the talks that you attended. 

 

**Steps**

You will create your poster/spread as a “portrait” layout in canva. It can be one or two pages. For inspiration, see the GHC posters located in the NI [Tech Zines](https://issuu.com/ncidigitalresearchlab). 

The poster should be organized, proofread/peer reviewed by two (2) GHC peers, visually appealing, and editable.  

Use slack to coordinate peer reviews.  

Once you have had your GHC peers proofread your poster, you will share the poster via Canva to the NCItech@wave.tulane.edu Canva account. By sharing your poster to the NCitech Canva account, you are giving us permission to publish your zine article.  Also send a draft of your poster to the NCItech@wave.tulane.edu account.  

First Draft Due for Peer Review: October 8 

Final Draft Due for Publication: October 15
