**Application**

To apply to GHC 2021, fill out the following [application](https://tulane.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/478593). 


**Conference and Zine**

Each GHC student is required to attend the majority of the GHC conference.  In addition to attending the meet and greets and resume workshop, during the conference, you must attend the  keynote, job fair, virtual networking events and at least two panels / talks.    

By October 8, you will submit a poster/spread that reviews your experience attending the Virtual Grace Hopper Event.   

Your review must include: 

- Name, year, major 

- A title that reflects the Grace Hopper Celebration 

- Several photos of you attending the virtual event and screenshots of the event.  

- A written reflection about your experience, how did you attend, what you learned, what opportunities you gained, advice for attending next year.  

- A written summary and review of the talks that you attended. 

 

**Steps**

You will create your poster/spread as a “portrait” layout in canva. It can be one or two pages. For inspiration, see the GHC posters located in the NI [Tech Zines](https://issuu.com/ncidigitalresearchlab). 

The poster should be organized, proofread/peer reviewed by two (2) GHC peers, visually appealing, and editable.  

Use slack to coordinate peer reviews.  

Once you have had your GHC peers proofread your poster, you will share the poster via Canva to the NCItech@wave.tulane.edu Canva account. By sharing your poster to the NCitech Canva account, you are giving us permission to publish your zine article.  Also send a draft of your poster to the NCItech@wave.tulane.edu account.  

First Draft Due for Peer Review: October 8 

Final Draft Due for Publication: October 15
