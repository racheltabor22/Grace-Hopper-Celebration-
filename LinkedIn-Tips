Creating an effective LinkedIn profile by Rena Repenning

LinkedIn is a great tool for networking, applying to jobs, talking to recruiters, and socializing. 
I reccomend using the free month trial during Grace Hopper. It will allow you to see who is viewing your profiled, and connects
you to applications and recruiters.

1. Add a professional profile picture
2. Add all job experiences using same title/date/explanation as resume
3. Add education and any extra curriculars besides work
4. Make sure to add a few skills. These are sometimes searched by recruiters.
5. Set your profile as "open to work." This Motivates recruiters to reach out to you directly.
6. Your bio is a great place to put your elevator pitch. Make sure to highlight your biggest interests,
best skills, and a bit of personality!
7. Connect with peers, friends, professors, former co-workers/bosses, etc
